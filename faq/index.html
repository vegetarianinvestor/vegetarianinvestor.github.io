        <h2 id="cruelty-free">Cruelty Free</h2>
<h3 id="what-are-vegetarian-investments">What are vegetarian investments?</h3>
<p>Vegetarian Investments are Cruelty Free Investments. Investments that are free from animal cruelty. We do not promote investments in companies that directly or indirectly harm or kill animals.</p>
<h3 id="what-kind-of-companies-cause-animal-cruelty">What kind of companies cause animal cruelty?</h3>
<p>Almost all companies in pharmaceuticals, poultry, animal husbandary, leather, pisciculture, biotechnology, agrochemicals and paints sector are involved in animal cruelty or are suppliers of raw materials to other companies hence directly supporting animal exploitation.</p>
<h3 id="how-many-companies-are-categorized-as-cruelty-free">How many companies are categorized as cruelty free?</h3>
<p>Most of the companies manufacturing cement and cememt products, electric utilities, renewable energy, power generation, telecom, automobiles do not cause any cruelty to animals and could be considered as green for investments</p>
<h3 id="who-are-these-cruelty-free-investments-for">Who are these cruelty free investments for?</h3>
<p>People who are very concerned about what ingredients the company&rsquo;s product contains or what the process is of making that product. The source of their concern is their deep attachment for the principle of ahinsa preached by their religion, or because they
have reverence for life. Anyone following jainism, veganism, vegetarianism, buddhism or those working for animal rights or are animal lovers themselves find this idea appealing.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-evaluation-criteria-for-cruelty-free-investments">What is the evaluation criteria for cruelty free investments?</h3>
<p>Companies that exploit animals in variety of ways are ignored in our screening process. Investments in companies that do cosmetic animal testing, factory farming, intensive animal agriculture, live animal export, manufactoring or serving food items that contain animal products are avoid.

<h2 id="investments">Investments</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-the-impact-of-my-investments-on-animals">What is the impact of my investments on animals?</h3>
<p>Out of all the aspects involved in a cruelty free lifestyle, investments have the most impact on animals. More than food or health products. A person eating non-veg food would kill few hundreds of animals in a year, while a person investing his savings every month in a non-vegetarian food or a poultry company would support and promote the company to expand his business further killing millions of animals every year.</p>
<h3 id="could-vegetarian-investments-be-considered-as-ethical-investments-or-socially-responsible-investments">Could vegetarian investments be considered as ethical investments or socially responsible investments?</h3>
<p>Yes, since the goal is to think about what kind of business is the company involved in before making an investment, these investments could be considered as ethical investments</p>
<h3 id="would-i-make-profits-by-making-cruelty-free-investments">Would I make profits by making cruelty free investments?</h3>
<p>Our goal is twofold - review businesses on cruelty grounds and then research, analyse and recommended businesses that suit your unique needs. These investments are just like any other where the goal is to make profits but with compassion</p>
<h2 id="mutual-funds">Mutual Funds</h2>
<h3 id="can-investments-in-mutual-funds-be-considered-green">Can investments in mutual funds be considered green?</h3>
<p>Most of the mutual funds do not restrict their holdings to a particular sector and hence could involve companies that cause animal cruelty. Sectorial mutual funds also do not stick to their chosen mandate for investment which in itself could be worded cleverly by using the words “investing predominantly” in companies of the particular sector. In addition to this, a disclaimer in their offer document could clearly state that there is no assurance that the investment objective of the scheme will be carried out. Hence investments in mutual funds are not considered as cruelty free investments. Read more on this <a href="https://vegetarianinvestments.in/blog/how-do-mutual-funds-lead-to-blood-money/">here</a></p>
<h3 id="what-is-blood-money">What is blood money?</h3>
<p>Investments in businesses violating principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahimsa">ahimsa</a> by involving infliction of gross cruelty on animals to obtain commercial value leads to blood money.</p>
<h2 id="do-it-yourself-service">Do It Yourself Service</h2>
<h3 id="how-can-i-start-with-cruelty-free-investments-myself">How can I start with cruelty free investments myself?</h3>
<p>Appreciate the decision that you have taken in saving lives of millions of animals. Once you have done a financial review of the assets and companies that you want to invest in, you can <a href="https://vegetarianinvestments.in/contact/">drop us an email</a> to do cruelty free review. Share the company names and we will revert back to let you know if they are cruelty free.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-i-find-out-if-my-existing-investments-are-cruelty-free">How can I find out if my existing investments are cruelty free?</h3>
<p>Investments in stocks, mutual funds, bonds or other debt instruments need to be reviewed through their holdings. One simple way to find out if your invested money is cruelty free would be to share the name of the mutual funds, stock holdings or bond details with us by <a href="https://vegetarianinvestments.in/contact/">dropping us a note</a>. We will revert back stating if your money is green. Be rest assured that this data would be kept anonymous and won&rsquo;t be shared with anyone.</p>
<h2 id="jainism">Jainism</h2>
<h3 id="is-the-cruelty-free-investment-idealogy-inline-with-jainism-principles-">Is the cruelty free investment idealogy inline with jainism principles ?</h3>
<p>Yes it is. One of the first and most important pillars of jainism is ahimsa. Do not injure, abuse, oppress, enslave, insult, torment, torture, or kill any creature or living being.</p>
<p>Practically it is impossible to find a business that does not kill or injure some of the smallest living beings but here we are trying to save ourselves as much as possible.</p>
<h2 id="veganism">Veganism</h2>
<h3 id="can-vegetarian-investments-be-considered-vegan">Can vegetarian &ldquo;investments&rdquo; be considered vegan?</h3>
<p>Yes vegetarian investments do respect vegan principles. We do not promote investments in aquaculture, poultry or dairy industries</p>
