        <h2 id="cruelty-free">Cruelty Free</h2>
<h3 id="what-are-vegetarian-investments">What are vegetarian investments?</h3>
<p>Vegetarian Investments are Cruelty Free Investments. Investments that are free from animal cruelty. We do not promote investments in companies that directly or indirectly harm or kill animals.</p>
<h3 id="what-kind-of-companies-cause-animal-cruelty">What kind of companies cause animal cruelty?</h3>
<p>Almost all companies in pharmaceuticals, poultry, animal husbandary, leather, pisciculture, biotechnology, agrochemicals and paints sector are involved in animal cruelty or are suppliers of raw materials to other companies hence directly supporting animal exploitation.</p>
<h3 id="how-many-companies-are-categorized-as-cruelty-free">How many companies are categorized as cruelty free?</h3>
<p>Most of the companies manufacturing cement and cememt products, electric utilities, renewable energy, power generation, telecom, automobiles do not cause any cruelty to animals and could be considered as green for investments</p>
<h3 id="who-are-these-cruelty-free-investments-for">Who are these cruelty free investments for?</h3>
<p>People who are very concerned about what ingredients the company&rsquo;s product contains or what the process is of making that product. The source of their concern is their deep attachment for the principle of ahinsa preached by their religion, or because they
have reverence for life. Anyone following jainism, veganism, vegetarianism, buddhism or those working for animal rights or are animal lovers themselves find this idea appealing.</p>
<h2 id="investments">Investments</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-the-impact-of-my-investments-on-animals">What is the impact of my investments on animals?</h3>
<p>Out of all the aspects involved in a cruelty free lifestyle, investments have the most impact on animals. More than food or health products. A person eating non-veg food would kill few hundreds of animals in a year, while a person investing his savings every month in a non-vegetarian food or a poultry company would support and promote the company to expand his business further killing millions of animals every year.</p>
<h3 id="could-vegetarian-investments-be-considered-as-ethical-investments-or-socially-responsible-investments">Could vegetarian investments be considered as ethical investments or socially responsible investments?</h3>
<p>Yes, since the goal is to think about what kind of business is the company involved in before making an investment, these investments could be considered as ethical investments</p>
<h3 id="would-i-make-profits-by-making-cruelty-free-investments">Would I make profits by making cruelty free investments?</h3>
<p>Our goal is twofold - review businesses on cruelty grounds and then research, analyse and recommended businesses that suit your unique needs. These investments are just like any other where the goal is to make profits but with compassion</p>
<h2 id="mutual-funds">Mutual Funds</h2>
<h3 id="can-investments-in-mutual-funds-be-considered-green">Can investments in mutual funds be considered green?</h3>
<p>Most of the mutual funds do not restrict their holdings to a particular sector and hence could involve companies that cause animal cruelty. Sectorial mutual funds also do not stick to their chosen mandate for investment which in itself could be worded cleverly by using the words “investing predominantly” in companies of the particular sector. In addition to this, a disclaimer in their offer document could clearly state that there is no assurance that the investment objective of the scheme will be carried out. Hence investments in mutual funds are not considered as cruelty free investments</p>
<h3 id="what-is-blood-money">What is blood money?</h3>
<p>Investments in businesses violating principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahimsa">ahimsa</a> by involving infliction of gross cruelty on animals to obtain commercial value leads to blood money.</p>
